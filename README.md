# ig-argv

simple argv parser

**Note:** this is still a work in progress, more and better docs are 
coming and the code is still evolving...


# Motivation

I needed a new argv parser for a quick and dirty project I was working on
and evaluating and selecting the propper existing parser and then learining its
API, quirks and adapting the architecture to it seemd to be more complicated,
require more effort and far less fun than putting together a trivial parser
myself in a couple of hours.  
This code is an evolution of that parser.
